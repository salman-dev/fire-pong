By Salman Allam, Ahmad Antar

After a long process, as a team we have decided to create a game based on 'pong' with our little fire twist called 'fire pong'

One of the many challenges in doing this game was to learn how to use gosu, and apply them in the code. the funnest part of creating this was the thrill of creating something out of nothing.

after running the app, it will show a message welcomign you to the game, followed by an instruction to etner both playres name.

after the names have been put down, the game will start, and the goal is to not let the ball go behind the fire bars. if it did the opposite player will receive a point and the game finishes once a player reaches 7 points.
